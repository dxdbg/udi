A list of possible enhancements/bugfixes
----------------------------------------
- catch fork, exec syscalls
- catch library events
- implement detach/attach
- implement register interface
  - partially complete, still needs support for retrieving FP registers.
- add documentation generation
- Need to handle abnormal termination of debuggee (via debuggee library error or SIGKILL)
- intercept calls to block signals so the debugger can still intercept the signals
- add file to UDI interface to allow multiple agents to cooperate via file locking
- handle case where user creates breakpoint at exit function
- implement debuggee-side conditional breakpoints
