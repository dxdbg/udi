A list of enhancements/bugfixes for the future
----------------------------------------------
* modify the default udi root filesystem procedure to include the username somehow to allow
multiple users to run programs that use udi

* allow user to specify the runtime library to be loaded when creating processes in libudi

* Need to handle abnormal termination of debuggee (via debuggee library error or SIGKILL)

* intercept calls to block signals so the debugger can still intercept the signals

* add file to UDI interface to allow multiple users to cooperate via file locking

* handle case where user creates breakpoint at exit function

* make udirt command execution re-entrant

* create malloc for exclusive use by udirt

* need thread support
