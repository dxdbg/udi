A list of enhancements/bugfixes for the future
----------------------------------------------
* investigate efficiency of udirt heap implementation

* catch fork, exec syscalls

* catch library events

* add single-stepping capability

* implement detach/attach

* implement register interface
  - partially complete, still needs support for retrieving FP registers.

* make libudi thread safe

* add Doxygen documentation generation

* allow user to specify the runtime library to be loaded when creating processes in libudi

* Need to handle abnormal termination of debuggee (via debuggee library error or SIGKILL)

* intercept calls to block signals so the debugger can still intercept the signals

* add file to UDI interface to allow multiple users to cooperate via file locking

* handle case where user creates breakpoint at exit function

* use rpath during linking to avoid use of LD_LIBRARY_PATH

* implement debuggee-side conditional breakpoints
