A list of enhancements/bugfixes for the future
----------------------------------------------
* allow user to specify the runtime library to be loaded when creating processes in libudi

* Need to handle abnormal termination of debuggee (via debuggee library error or SIGKILL)

* intercept calls to block signals so the debugger can still intercept the signals

* add file to UDI interface to allow multiple users to cooperate via file locking

* handle case where user creates breakpoint at exit function

* revamp libudi error handling to be maintained per-process

* implement register interface

* implement state command

* implement debuggee-side conditional breakpoints

* add Doxygen documentation generation

* use rpath during linking to avoid use of LD_LIBRARY_PATH

* create type for error string (replace errmsg and errmsg_size)
