A list of enhancements/bugfixes for the future
----------------------------------------------
[ ] modify the default udi root filesystem procedure to include the username somehow to allow
multiple users to run programs that use udi

[ ] allow user to specify the runtime library to be loaded when creating processes in libudi

[ ] Need to handle abnormal termination of debuggee (via debuggee library error or SIGKILL)

[ ] Need to catch implicit exit via libc (programs that return exit code from main)
-- this can be done by setting a breakpoint at exit's entry, address can be obtained from
the dynamic linker

[ ] intercept calls to block signals so the debugger can intercept the signals
